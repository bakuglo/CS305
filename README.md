For this task, I worked as a developer for Global Rain, a company specializing in custom software design and development for various clients worldwide. Our mission, “Security is everyone’s responsibility,” guided our work with Artemis Financial to modernize their operations and enhance software security. Artemis Financial, which uses a RESTful API, sought our expertise to protect against external threats. Although I felt my performance was adequate, the constantly evolving field of online security presents challenges.

Securing transactions and communications is crucial, especially for financial institutions, to protect customer data and company information. Given that Artemis Financial develops individualized financial plans, it's vital to secure all communications involving customer accounts. To secure their system, I focused on key aspects: ensuring code quality for readability, implementing secure coding practices like exception handling and error checks, using proper cryptography to protect data integrity and confidentiality, securing client/server communications, and configuring the API securely. Additionally, incorporating a dependency-check plugin scanner helps ensure code security and keeps dependencies current, reducing potential vulnerabilities.
